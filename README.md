Scroll through pictures on your pebble with digital time and date.

Cloned and modified from Pebble-SexRoulette by vvzvlad (Thanks, with respect)          
See your own pictures along with the time and date.  Using 3 buttons to scroll through 
your pictures, top button as a Previous, bottom Button as Next, center as Random.      
  
Create your pictures for resources on this link:  http://gazs.github.io/canvas-atkinson-dither/   
Import the picture you want, under "Fit Picture In" choose other and set it to 144x168 (approx).  
Save it to your desktop, it will create a file called "download", no extension.  Rename it to     
Pic00.png, etc..., Repeat for up to 28 pictures or as many as will end up compiling/running on the
watch.  Now add them as a resource with "Add New" button set "Identifier" to PIC00,...PIC27       
Compile the watch app - if its over 100KiB, then delete or shrink some pics, it won't load onto   
the watch if over 100Kib, at least that is what I have found - Results may vary!
